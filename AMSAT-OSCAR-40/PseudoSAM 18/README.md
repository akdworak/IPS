     Dear User:


     All PseudoSam(Pseudo brand Symbolic AsseMbler) assemblers conform to
     a common syntax based on the UNIX system V assembler syntax. The opcode
     and addressing syntax is compatible with the manufacturers but label,
     directive, and expression operator syntax will in general differ.
     The Author chose this syntax because of the popularity of the
     Unix system and to avoid the difficulty of maintaining compatibilty
     with the multitude of OEM assemblers.

     Through arrangement with Oxgate BBS of York County, VA bugs can
     be reported by message to Pseudo Sam.  This system is normally online
     24 hrs a day, seven days a week and can communicate from 300 to
     2400 baud. Update information will be also be periodically
     provided.


     You are advised to thoroughly read the user manual, paying close
     attention to the expression and directive syntax descriptions.

     Although V1.2.02 does not support such useful features as Macros,
     Relocatability, Include files, and Conditional Assembly you will
     find PseudoSam assemblers capable tools for developing microprocessor
     based systems.

     Thank You for using PseudoCode products.

     P.S.  V2.0.00 will include macros, include files, and conditional

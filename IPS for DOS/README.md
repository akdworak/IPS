# IPS for MS-DOS

An IPS emulator system called IPSDOS is available for the PC in English and German language version.
This was designed to run under pure DOS, and provides facilities for direct access to I/O and communication ports. 
IPSDOS can run in a window under Windows 9x and Windows NT/2000/XP. Full documentation and source code in Pascal are provided.

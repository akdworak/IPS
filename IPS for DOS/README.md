# IPS for MS-DOS

An IPS emulator system called IPSDOS is available for the PC in English and German language version.
This was designed to run under pure DOS, and provides facilities for direct access to I/O and communication ports. 
IPSDOS can run in a window under Windows 9x and Windows NT/2000/XP. Full documentation and source code in Pascal are provided.

This is classic 16-bit IPS implementation.

Update 2019-08-12 from Peter DB2OS and Paul VP9MU:

Unfortunatly the "IPS" german version is an older version, the latest ZIP file was corrupted and can not be restored.
However, If you have the English version working, then you have the source code for the German version in the IPSX folder. Youâ€™ll need to load the IPS-X kernel and compile the German version kernel.

The default kernel was the only different between the two zips.

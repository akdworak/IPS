Dear James,

enclosed also some files of my attempts to recover AO-10
in November 86, when the IHU memory died...

Unfortunatly I lost track of most of what I have done.
But I remember having only a few hours of sleep, since
AO-10 war around in the middle of the night and over
the day I had to go to University..hi
This was for a period of a couple of weeks, maybe 1-2 month
and that I was totaly exhausted like the computer memory
was. At the end, new program worked just for one day
and crashed again. Finally the radiation was eating more
memory, faster than I could program around. My last
program was running when the memory was 90% dead or so..
Well, than I had to gave up and also I urgently needed
my holiday because this realy was not good for my healty
and heart. Never I will do this again..hi  But it was
indeed an excellent training before AO-13 went into 
orbit..

This is just a little (not so?) funny storry..hi

Best 73s de Peter

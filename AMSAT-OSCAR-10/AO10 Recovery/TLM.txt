
Hi  to all.  My TLM-Routine is now running nearly 5 hours  without 
problems.  Healthy off  OSCAR-10 looks good  with  positive  power 
budget.  The  value off U-BCR-IN seems to bee wrong due to  memory 
failure.  But  U-BCR-OUT  and 14V-ST looks a little bit  too  high 
(15V).  I wonder that A-BAT (auxillary battery?) is also  15V.  In 
the  next few days (when OSCAR is again in a good  visibility  for 
me) I will reset the BCR-Values (BCR-SIN and BCR-SO, which latched 
in the BCR itself) to 28V / 13.9V. 

Use  the  following IPS-definition on ATARI 800XL to  display  the 
incoming telemetry:

: TLM  #9200 64 + ( from YD-Buffer ) #8380 ( to Q-Block ) 64 >>> ;

Usage:
       TLM COM
       TLM PWR
       TLM TEMP
       TLM NAV
     
Rem:  TLM  copies  the 64 telemetrie values  into  the  processing 
buffer  (normally  the Q-Block).  The second operator is  used  to 
update the QD-Display (i.e power, temperatures, etc.)


Good Luck,  73 de Peter DB2OS

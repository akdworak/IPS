# IPS for Windows

IPS-Win is a variant of James Miller's IPS-M, which has been ported to the PC Windows environment by Stacey Mills, W4SM. IPS-Win is written in Borland C++ Builder. It has purposely been written to be the same in respect to input/output and the "feel" of the user interface as the original IPS-N, as described in the book.

Complete package with English and German versions.
This is classic 16-bit IPS implementation.
